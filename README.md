# clue-hackathon
Clue-WATTx hackathon is my contribution to the hackathon.

- Website: http://cluehackathon.wattx.io/
- Original example submission repository: https://github.com/WATTx/cluehackathon

The submission and starting point of train scripts are copied from the above repository.

## Ground Rules
My idea is to collaborate towards a better result at the end of the hackathon.

Everyone is invited to use the code, w/o my consent and knowledge, and use it the way
they think is appropriate to the task at hand. Needless to say, pull requests, branches, and ideas
are more than welcome.

In any chance, my submissions from this repository win any prize,
everyone with any accepted pull-request will have an equal share of the prize. 
Ideally, everyone basing any submission on this repo would do the same, but they don't have to,
and I claim nothing out of their changes and submissions.

## Data Description
Here comes some general info about the data.

## Methods
Ideas, from pre-processing to the end.

## Results
What we get out of it.
